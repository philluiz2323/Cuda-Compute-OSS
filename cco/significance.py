"""
cco/significance.py — challenger-vs-champion win decision (Step 6).

A challenger kernel takes the crown only if it is BOTH:
  1. statistically faster than the current champion (low p-value), AND
  2. faster by at least a real margin (effect size above the GPU noise floor).

The test is a **one-sided Mann-Whitney U** on the two latency samples (lower latency = faster),
deliberately NOT a Welch t-test: GPU clock-boost is often bimodal, which violates the t-test's
normality assumption and makes it misfire (a red-team finding). Mann-Whitney is nonparametric —
it only assumes the samples are comparable — so bimodal boost doesn't break it. The samples are
the per-block median latencies that benchmark.py emits (champion and challenger re-run fresh and
interleaved in the same sealed job, so they share thermal state).

This decision is made by the gate pipeline (it consumes two score blobs); benchmark.py only
produces samples and never decides. Pure stdlib (math/statistics) — no scipy/numpy dependency.

Usage:
    uv run --no-project python cco/significance.py --self-test

    raw point estimate, which noise alone pushes over the margin for a borderline kernel.

    This is conservative BY DESIGN (the incumbent champion holds unless confidently beaten -> no
    crown-thrash on noise). Cost: the EFFECTIVE bar sits somewhat above `min_improvement_pct` depending on
    the latency noise. Monte-Carlo (n_blocks=30): a true +4.9% kernel — which the old point-estimate gate
    crowned 26-44% of the time — now wins ~3%; at locked-clock CoV ~5% a true +8% wins ~50% and +12%
    ~99% (lower noise on the production locked-clock host shifts these up). Calibrate `min_improvement_pct`
